                <h1>Who is Lynn?</h1><br>
                <p>I'm Lynn Delaere, I'm <span id="age"></span> year's old and i'm currently a student at VIVES
                    University of Applied Sciences in Bruges where I study Electronics-ICT.
                </p><br>
                <p>In 2015, I've graduated as a vet nurse at VIVES University of Applied Sciences in Roeselare. 
                    After my studies, I started working as a shop assistant in various retail business. 
                    Working in retail was a great experience for me, I learned a lot about customer service and how to work in a team.
                </p>
                <p>After a few years in retail I wanted to try something new and started working as a field technician at Anticimex. 
                    I've learned a lot about pest control and had the opportunity to work with a many different people.
                </p><br>
                <p>But after a while I noticed that I wasn't happy with my job anymore. I wanted to do something more challenging, something that would make truly happy. 
                    In 2023, with the support of my friends and family I decided to quit my job and go back to school.
                </p><br>
                <p>I've always been interested in technology and computers and I wanted to learn more about it. 
                    Now a year later, I'm in my second year Electronics-ICT and I'm still happy with my decision. 
                    I'm learning new things every day and I'm excited to see what the future will bring.
                </p><br>
                <p>My goal is to not only to improve my skills but also to inspire others to follow their dreams and do what makes them happy.
