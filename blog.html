                <h1 id="post3">From Coding Challenges to Watercress AI</h1>
                <p><i>11 October '24</i></p>
                <p>It's been two weeks since my last blog post, and a lot has happened in that time.
                    The time has flown by—the watercress is starting to grow, and I'm flooded with new information.</p>
                <p>I've learned how to set up my own REST API in Node.js, use Postman to test the API, and MySQL to
                    store the data.
                    I completed the assignment for the REST API chapter, where I had to create a REST API that could
                    store, retrieve, update, and delete data.
                    Since I had never worked with REST APIs before, it was quite a challenge, but I managed to get it
                    working, and I'm proud of the result.</p>
                <p>I also had my first assignment for C++ programming, where I needed to write a program that could read
                    a log file and extract information from it.
                    The first part of the assignment went smoothly, but the second part was trickier—I had to display
                    the top 3 most logged items in the file.
                    It wasn't as easy as I thought, but with some help and a lot of trial and error, I eventually got it
                    working.</p>
                <p>My first continuous evaluation in AI programming with Python went well. The initial assignments were
                    pretty straightforward,
                    but the last three were a bit more complex. I had to write a program that could read in a table from
                    a specific website, extract the data,
                    and display it in a graph.</p>
                <p>The most exciting part of the past two weeks has definitely been the Watercress AI project.
                    The watercress is growing well, and as it develops, I'm taking daily photos to document its
                    progress.
                    Some plants are growing faster than others, while a few aren't growing at all, giving us a nice
                    variety of growth stages to study.
                    I'm labeling the photos using <a href="https://labelbox.com/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Labelbox</a>, a tool that makes it
                    easy to label images for machine learning.</p>
                <p>I brought the Raspberry Pi home to learn how to use it and get more comfortable with it.
                    I successfully made an SSH connection to it, which means I can work on it from my laptop.
                    Getting that to work felt like a huge accomplishment! I also created a simple program that takes a
                    picture using the button
                    on the Sense HAT and displays the number of pictures taken on the LED matrix.
                    It wasn't as easy as I thought it would be— I had to look up a lot of things, but that's how you
                    learn, right?</p>
                <p>The project leader has asked us to create a dashboard where we can see the pictures we've taken, the
                    predicted age of the watercress,
                    and the actual age of the watercress using a Streamlit app. I've never worked with Streamlit before,
                    so I'm excited to dive into it
                    and learn how to use it. There's a lot of work ahead, but I'm feeling optimistic and ready for the
                    challenge!</p>
                <p>Overall, it's been a busy and rewarding couple of weeks, and I'm excited to see where this project
                    will lead.
                    I'm looking forward to learning more and sharing my progress with all of you!</p>

                <h1 id="post2">Rise of the watercress</h1>
                <p><i>27 September '24</i></p>
                <p>The first week of school has officially wrapped up, and what a week it has been! With a few new
                    teachers and bunch of
                    interesting new courses, things are off to an exiting start. Some of the classes felt like a review
                    of things i had seen before,
                    like when to use let, const, or var in JavaScript, or the basics of C++ programming. But there were
                    also a few things I hand't encountered before,
                    which made it all the more exciting.</p>
                <p>For example, in my IoT Devices course, I learned about a much easier way to assign a function to a
                    specific IO pin.
                    We used a program called STM32CubeMX, where you can select the microcontroller you're working with,
                    configure the pins,
                    and then generate the code to use in Keil µVision. The whole process was so simple and intuitive.
                    Now, I'm wandering if it will stay that way?</p>
                <p>Since I'm in my second year, I have a more elective courses than last year. One of them is AI
                    programming in Python, where I'll learn how to build and train an AI model. To develop a good AI
                    model, I'll need to know how to collect
                    and interpret data effectively. I'm really excited to dive into AI and everything that comes with
                    it.
                    There's so much potential in this field, and I can't wait to learn more.</p>
                <p><b>Now, for the moment you've all been waiting for: What project did I get?</b></p>
                <p>Drummroll please...</p>
                <p>I'm on the Watercress AI project team! This week, we had our first meeting with the project leader,
                    who gave us a lot of insight
                    into what we'll be working on. He's a researcher at the school and has extensive knowledge in AI,
                    machine leaning, and deep learning.</p>
                <p>The goal of the project is to create a standalone device that can predict the growth stage of
                    watercress plants based on a picture. We'll be using a Raspberry Pi
                    with a camera and a display to show the predicted age of the watercress.</p>
                <p><b>The plan</b></p>
                <p>To get accurate date, we'll plant several batches of watercress at home. Every day, we'll take
                    pictures
                    from different angles, in various lighting conditions, and with different cameras. Then, we'll label
                    those photos
                    and divide them into three data sets: a training set to teach the AI model, a validations set to
                    fine-tune it, and a test set to
                    evaluate how well the model performs.</p>
                <p>Every Thursday, we have a full day dedicated to the project. This week's goal was to brainstorm and
                    come up with a solid action plan
                    for the next few weeks. There's a lot of work ahead, but I'm feeling optimistic! We've already tried
                    out the Raspberry Pi and the camera,
                    so we're comfortable with the technology. I can't wait to see how this project unfolds.</p>
                <p>Stay tuned for more updates on the Watercress AI project!</p>

                <h1 id="post1">Choosing projects</h1>
                <p><i>19 September '24</i></p>
                <p><b>Here it goes, my first blog post is official &#128513;!</b></p>
                <p>Today I had an info session about the projects we can choose from in our the first semester.
                    The big theme of most of the projects is Smart Greenhouse-how can we make a greenhouse self
                    sustainable?
                    Some examples are: greenhouse water system, greenhouse energy, greenhouse sensoring, ect.</p>
                <p>There are also two other projects that are not related to the Smart Greenhouse theme.
                    One of them is a project about smart cameras to grow watercress by collecting data and make an AI
                    model to predict the growth of the watercress.</p>
                <p>The other project involves making CoMoveIT, an intelligent wheelchair steering system, compatible
                    with Linx motor-steering-based wheelchairs.
                    This project is in collaboration with the company CoMoveIT. I will put a link to their website down
                    below if you want to check it out.</p>
                <p>So as you can see, there are a lot of interesting projects to choose from. I have to send in my top 3
                    choices to the school by the end of the week.
                    I haven't read all the details about every project yet, so thats the plan for this week.
                    I've set a personal deadline to have my top 3 choices by Thursday evening.</p>
                <p>For now I'll end this post by sharing my top 3 choices at the moment:
                <ol>
                    <li>Watercress AI</li>
                    <li>CoMoveIT interface</li>
                    <li>Greenhouse sensoring</li>
                </ol>
