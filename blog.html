                <p><i>19 September '24</i><br></p>
                <p>Here it goes, my first blog post is official &#128513;!<br></p>
                <p>Today we had an info session about the projects we can choose from in our the first semester. 
                    The big theme of most of the projects is Smart Greenhouse-how can we make a greenhouse self sustainable?
                    Some examples are: greenhouse water system, greenhouse energy, greenhouse sensoring, ect.</p>
                <p>There are also two other projects that are not related to the Smart Greenhouse theme. 
                    One of them is a project about smart cameras to grow watercress by collecting data and make an AI model to predict the growth of the watercress.</p>
                <p>The other project involves making CoMoveIT, an intelligent wheelchair steering system, compatible with Linx motor-steering-based wheelchairs. 
                    This project is in collaboration with the company CoMoveIT. I will put a link to their website down below if you want to check it out.</p>
                <p>So as you can see, there are a lot of interesting projects to choose from. We have to send our top 3 choices to the school by the end of the week.
                I haven't read all the details about every project yet, so thats the plan for this week. 
                I've set a personal deadline to have my top 3 choices by Thursday evening.</p>
                <p>For now I'll end this post by sharing my top 3 choices at the moment: 
                <ol>
                    <li>Watercress AI</li>
                    <li>CoMoveIT interface</li>
                    <li>Greenhouse sensoring</li>
                </ol>          
                </p>
